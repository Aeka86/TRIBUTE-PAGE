        Ayka (Russian: Айка) is a 2018 drama film directed by Sergey Dvortsevoy
      </h2>
      <p>
        The story is centered around a young Kyrgyz woman named Ayka who lives
        in Moscow, Russia. After giving birth to a baby, she abandons the
        newborn, escaping through a hospital window. She is desperate for
        income, as she owes money to criminals but now struggles to repay the
        debt. She returns to a job plucking chicken feathers. After the work is
        done, the men running the operation leave without paying their workers.
        Trying to regain another previous job, Ayka finds that she has been
        permanently replaced while in labor. With her work permit expired and
        pain and complications from the pregnancy, it is nearly impossible for
        her to find or keep another employment. Ayka finally gets a part-time
        job as a cleaner at the veterinary clinic.

        Debt collectors find her and demand she return their money, threatening
        to torture her sister back in Kyrgyzstan. She confesses to them about
        the recent birth of a son, saying that she became pregnant as a result
        of rape. They offer to take her child in order to settle her debts.
